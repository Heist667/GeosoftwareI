    <h1>First assignment, Thomas Kujawa</h1>
    <p>This assignment takes two different datas, called route.js and polygon.js. It has to show different sections between a given route running through a given polygon.
       The sections should be sorted by descending length. Both, start and end points of the sections have to be shown.
       The last column should make clear, if the section is inside or outside the polygon.
       The lengths are rounded to three decimals places.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Sequence</th>
            <th>Length (in meter)</th>
            <th>Position to polygon</th>
            <th>Start-point (longitude, latitude)</th>
            <th>End-point (longitude, latitude)</th>

        </tr>
        <tBody id="tbody"></tBody> <!-- The code to display the body of the table is generated by the function (createTableHTML()) in the uebung1_main.js file-->
